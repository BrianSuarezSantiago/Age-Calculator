## 📚 Fundamentals

The software available in this repository allows the calculation of a person's age by taking into account the difference in milliseconds between the current date and the person's date of birth.


## 👨🏻‍💻 Implementation

The development of this practice consists of the creation of a Person class where a certain person is represented and whose purpose is the calculation of his/her age. The software consists of three versions where use is made of different Java libraries for the implementation of this purpose.

### 1️⃣ <ins>First version:</ins>

The first version of this software makes use of the *Date* library of Java which is actually deprecated.
